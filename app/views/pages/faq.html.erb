		Q: What is the timing for applying?
	</div>
	<div class="answer">
<p>
<strong>A:</strong> There will be two rounds of grant-making in the 2014-15 academic year, so students in both the fall and spring semesters can participate in the reading and ranking of proposals.
</p>

<p>
The first deadline is September 8th, with notification of awards in November. The second deadline is February 9th, with notification in April.
</p>

We expect to award a total of $45,000 in these two cycles.

	<div class="question">
		Q: What size grants are available?
	</div>
	<div class="answer">
		<strong>A:</strong> There are two types of grants available: <br>
		&nbsp&nbsp■	Mini-Grant: up to $1,000, or <br>
		&nbsp&nbsp■	Garden Hill Grant: between $2,000-10,000 <br>
	Each application should address the rationale for the specific grant amount.	<br>
	Since we will have a limited amount of money to award in grants, the Committee WILL consider partial funding in some cases. If you are asking for a large grant, it will be helpful to know how partial funding would affect your proposed project.

	<div class="question">
		Q: Who will decide which projects receive funding?

	<div class="answer">
		<strong>A:</strong> The Alumni Committee will make the grants, with input from a selection of Mountain School students, faculty, and donors.  Visit <a href="http://gardenhillfund.org">http://gardenhillfund.org</a> for a description of the evaluation process.

		Q: How do I donate to the Garden Hill Fund?
	</div>
	<div class="answer">
		<strong>A:</strong> The first year pilot has been made possible by the generous gifts of 10 graduates, ranging from Spring ‘85 to Spring ‘97.

	<div class="answer">
		<strong>A:</strong> 
		All grant recipients will be asked to report back to the Alumni Committee within one year to describe their project outcomes or progress to date.

		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp○		other creative ideas are welcomed!
